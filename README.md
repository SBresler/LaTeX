#Welcome to Sean Bresler's GitHub LaTeX project!
#
#To get started, you will need:
#	1)TeX (or TeX variant) editor
#	2)TeX Compiler
#
#I reccomend TeXShop and macTeX
#
#I have compiled PDFs on the repository for now. I will eventually take these	away in favor of only having files required to compile the output PDF
#
